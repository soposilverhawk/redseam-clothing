# Project Name - Designo Website
This is a solution to the [Redberry Bootcamp ecommerce website - RedSeam Clothing]

# The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View clothing products populated by a backend API
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Filter items based on price range
- View product items in descending, ascending and date of creation orders
- Register on the website
- Login using email and password
- View individual product items on click of their respective cards
- Add, update and remove the items from the cart
- View cart preview when logged in
- Place purchase after filling out order details form
- Receive backend API error messages when any of the form data is not submitted correctly, e.g:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "The field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "The email field must be a valid email address"

# Building the Project


# What We learned and Practiced 
Working on the Redberry e-commerce webiste allowed me to gain hands-on experience with real-world web development practices. Throughout the project, I strengthened my technical skills and better saw the key areas where I can further imrpove my knowledge and understanding.

## Learned:
- How to work with real backend API data
- How to practically implement context API to manage global state
- How to make smart pagination
- How to utilize custom hooks

## areas to improve:
- Handling errors when working with backend data
- Optimization of context usage (introducing more practical usage of context where necessary)
- Handling loading states
- Refactoring practices
